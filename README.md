# SML-signature-structure

 The projcet is divided into two parts.
 In the first part I implement a dictionary data structure.
 
 1.  The signature DICTIONARY defines a type and a programming interface for   the dictionary data structure. The data structure allows us to store   data in the form of (key, value) pairs and to query the data using a key. 
 
 2. The signature COOKBOOK defines types and a programming interface to work   with ingredients, stock, recipes, prices and cookbooks.
